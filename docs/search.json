    "text": "Thumbnail\n\n\nWhat are the best puns? Definitely the ones only a specific group of people will understand and enjoy. Especially in the era we’re living in, we need to feel like a family and share “inside” jokes with one another. So, let’s take a look at some of the best programming puns we came upon during the pre-summer times.\n\nWhy do programmers like dark mode?\n\nBecause light attracts bugs.\n\nI used to work as a programmer for autocorrect…\n\nThen they fried me for no raisin.\n\nWhat do NASA programmers do on the weekends?\n\nThey hit the space bar.\n\nWhy did the programmer quit his job?\n\nBecause he didn’t get arrays.\n\nWhat was the SNES programmers’ favorite drink?\n\nSprite\n\nWhat do programmers do when they’re hungry?\n\nThey grab a byte.\n\nWhy couldn’t the programmer dance to the song?\n\nBecause he didn’t get the… algo-rhythm…\n\nWhat you call it when computer programmers make fun of each other?\n\nCyber boolean…\n\nI am now a successful programmer…\n\nBut back in the days I was a noobgrammer.\n\nWhy do programmers always mix up Halloween and Christmas?\n\nBecause Oct 31 equals Dec 25.\n\nWhy did the programmer get a huge telephone bill?\n\nBecause his program was CALLING a lot of subroutines.\n\nWhat do Spanish programmers code in?\n\nSí ++\n\nWhich way did the programmer go?\n\nHe went data way!\n\nWhy was the programmer always running into walls?\n\nHe couldn’t see sharp.\n\nHow programmers curse?\n\nOh shift!\n\nWhy do programmers make good politicians?\n\nTheir goto is to switch statements.\n\nHow did the programmer lose weight?\n\nHe switched to a byte-sized diet.\n\nI almost bought a huge library out of old computer programming books…\n\nBut the ascii price was way too high.\n\nWhat’s a Jedi’s favorite programming language?\n\nJabbaScript…\n\n\n\nWant to learn programming and become an expert?\nIf you’re serious about learning Programming and getting a job as a Developer, I highly encourage you to enroll in my programming courses for Python, JavaScript, Data Science and Web Development.\nDon’t waste your time following disconnected, outdated tutorials. I can teach you all that you need to kickstart your career.\nContact me at +256771754118 or jumashafara@proton.me\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",
